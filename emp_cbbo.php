                                    <p>Mahashakti Foundation has been appointed as a CBBO by NABARD to mobilize farmers and promote FPOs in 38 Blocks of  5 Districts of Odisha. Under this setup, Mahashakti works with farmers to enhance their existing capacities, impart training programs to let them understand the current best practices to overcome climate change-related stresses, and encourage them to take up business activities that coincide with their strengths areas.</p>
                                    <p>Fragmented small farmer holdings pose major problems for on-farm productivity and farm income improvement. Farmer producers’ organizations have emerged as an effective mechanism to transform such small holding-based farming into a viable agri-business enterprise and to increase the net income of farmers. Through collectivization and aggregation, FPOs acquire better access to credit, inputs, technology, market, post-harvest management, value addition, etc.</p>

Conversely, in 2023-24, there was a 31% increase in the member base and a 47% rise in share capital. Given the nascent stage of FPOs in 2021-22, the subsequent year witnessed significant growth. Sustaining the growth rate of 2023-24 is crucial to achieving economies of scale.</p>
