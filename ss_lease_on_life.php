                                    <p>Ranjan Nayak, a disabled tribal man from Bankataila in Takra Gram Panchayat, has endured an incredibly challenging life. Tragedy struck when he lost his wife, leaving him physically and emotionally shattered. As his family fractured under the weight of personal struggles, his son and daughter separated from him, leaving Ranjan to fend for himself.<br><br>Living in a mud hut built on government land, Ranjan struggled daily. His disability prevented him from cooking or performing basic tasks. With no regular income, he depended on the kindness of villagers for sustenance and relied solely on five kilograms of rice provided under the food security scheme. Despite possessing a 90% disability certificate, the lack of awareness and communication with local authorities had deprived him of critical entitlements, including a disability allowance and a tricycle for mobility.<br><br>However, hope arrived through Project Adhikaar, a collaboration between the Mahashakti Foundation and Tata Power Central Odisha Distribution Limited, which aims to address issues of entitlement for the underprivileged. During a village survey, the Adhikaar Saathis identified Ranjan’s case as a priority. They mobilized community groups, engaged with local block officials, and ensured that Ranjan’s paperwork was completed and submitted. Their persistent efforts paid off.

                                    On November 18, 2024, the block administration responded promptly by providing Ranjan with a tricycle. This simple yet life-changing intervention has restored a sense of dignity and independence in his life as he could now fetch water from the tube well and visit neighboring villages with ease.<br><br>The intervention didn’t stop there. With the continued support of Project Adhikaar, Ranjan has applied for a disability allowance, further ensuring long-term financial stability. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Mahashakti Foundation, TPCODL, the block administration, and Project Adhikaar Saathis for the unwavering support he received.<br><br>Ranjan Nayak’s story stands as a testament to the transformative power of community action, grassroots initiatives, and institutional support.</p>
