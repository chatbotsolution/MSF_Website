                                    <p>The Integrated Village Development Programme (IVDP) is a multi-dimensional initiative designed to create resilient, self-sustaining rural communities by addressing their most pressing developmental needs across various interconnected sectors, which includes interventions on education as well. <br>
                                    The IVDP strengthened academic access and learning environments across all three blocks by establishing dedicated coaching centres, upgrading classroom infrastructure, and mobilizing community stakeholders. In Gudvella, a free Learning Centre now supports students in classes 7–10 with subject‐specific coaching and mentoring . Simultaneously, many sets of benches and desks were distributed to each of three upper‐primary schools benefiting over 100 students – and RO drinking‐water systems, repaired toilets, kitchen sheds, veranda shelters, and hand‐washing stations were installed in two schools and two Anganwadi centres to ensure safe, inclusive facilities. In Madanpur Rampur, the Swami Vivekananda Learning Centre offers structured support to 9th–10th graders, while many bench‐desks equipped one school, and water tanks, submersible pumps and sanitation upgrades were completed in three schools and two Anganwadis. Paikmal block saw boys’ urinals and repaired toilets installed in two upper‐primary schools, and Anganwadi centres received building renovations, RO water points, fencing and hand‐wash stations to uplift hygiene standards .

                                        Beyond bricks‐and‐mortar improvements, IVDP actively engaged School Management Committees, PRI members and parents in planning and oversight, fostering local ownership and maintenance. Culturally tailored “Nukkad Nataks” on the Right to Education and National Education Policy sensitized over 1,000 villagers to the value of schooling. Early indications show higher attendance, reduced dropouts, and renewed community confidence, thereby laying a solid foundation for sustained educational gains.
