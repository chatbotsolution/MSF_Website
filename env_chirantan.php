                                    <p>Project Chirantan, supported by HDFC Bank Parivartan integrates a climate-resilient approach to sustainable agriculture through impactful interventions in water conservation, soil health, pest control, and seed diversity. Focused on the environmentally vulnerable blocks of Kankadahada and Bhuban in the aspirational district of Dhenkanal, the project introduces drip irrigation systems, Integrated Pest and Nutrient Management practices, and promotes indigenous, drought-resistant pulse varieties. These initiatives aim to conserve natural resources, reduce chemical dependency, and enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change. By combining modern techniques with traditional knowledge, the project strengthens agro-ecological sustainability while improving productivity and food security. </p>

                                    <p>Farmers in the Kankadahada and Bhuban blocks have long endured the impacts of severe water scarcity, which has repeatedly undermined crop consistency and yields. Reliance on traditional flood‐irrigation methods has not only led to excessive water loss but also aggravated soil erosion and degraded land health. To address these challenges, our project is introducing drip irrigation as a sustainable alternative, minimizing water waste, preserving soil moisture, and enhancing crop resilience against climate variability.<br>Working hand‐in‐hand with lead farmers, our team first conducted detailed feasibility assessments for eighteen beneficiaries, evaluating the availability of permanent water sources and the potential for year‐round cultivation. We then enabled financial inclusion by facilitating bank‐account openings and completing all necessary documentation at Fino Banks. In partnership with the Horticulture Department, we secured work orders and supported farmers through trenching and preparatory field labor. Installation of drip‐irrigation systems is now underway across eighteen acres of farmland. In addition, we have leveraged MGNREGA support to cultivate Apple Ber on one acre of Individual Forest Rights (IFR) land belonging to a farmer of Bhalutangar village, further diversifying and strengthening local livelihoods. <br>By delivering water directly to the root zone, drip irrigation can reduce overall water consumption by up to 50%, significantly improving irrigation efficiency and ensuring uniform soil moisture. This precision watering not only boosts crop productivity but also cuts down manual labour, and reduces the time required to irrigate their whole land substantially. This helps in freeing farmers to focus on other vital field operations.</p>

                                    <p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) constitutes a cornerstone of our climate-resilient agriculture framework, equipping farmers to anticipate and adapt to climatic variability while preserving soil health and biodiversity. By prioritizing biological controls and cultural practices over synthetic inputs, IPM enhances long-term productivity, reduces environmental impact, and strengthens the ecosystem.<br>Through this initiative, 200 farmers have been systematically trained to formulate and deploy eco-friendly IPM interventions. Preparation of botanicals such as neem oil and neem cake, alongside strategically placed yellow and blue sticky traps, participants are now able to monitor pest populations and intervene precisely, minimizing collateral damage to beneficial organisms. Lead farmers have further institutionalized peer-to-peer learning via structured field days and on-farm demonstrations, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. As a result, communities report markedly lower dependence on chemical pesticides, improved crop safety, and more resilient agro-ecosystems.</p>
                                    <h3 class="heading-inner">INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT (INM)</h3>
                                    <p>Integrated Nutrient Management serves as a cornerstone of our sustainable soil management strategy, particularly in the context of evolving climate pressures. By integrating judicious applications of organic manures, chemical fertilizers, and bio-inoculants, INM preserves soil fertility, stimulates beneficial microbial activity, and enhances soil structure to optimize crop nutrition. Under this initiative, 200 farmers were provided with customized INM inputs and engaged in immersive, hands-on training on compost preparation, organic nutrient solution formulation, and natural biopesticide production. Delivered through practical field demonstrations and peer-learning sessions, these workshops have fortified farmers’ capacity to implement regenerative soil management practices, thereby securing long-term productivity and ecosystem resilience.</p>

                                    <p>Indigenous pulse seeds play a crucial role in the rainfed regions of Dhenkanal, offering resilience against climate variability, enhancing soil fertility, and providing nutritious food for both humans and livestock. They are essential for promoting sustainable agriculture and ensuring nutritional security. During the initial village meetings, farmers worked together to map seed diversity and assess the current availability of traditional varieties. One such variety, the drought-tolerant Jhain Moong (a local green gram), has been steadily declining due to limited access to quality seeds, issues like open grazing, and the absence of a cluster-based cultivation approach. With support from lead farmers, the project team identified these challenges and collected 1,600 kg of Jhain Moong seeds from villages in a neighboring block. These were distributed among 200 farmers, with each receiving 8 kg for cultivation and conservation purposes. In total, 200 acres were brought under Jhain Moong cultivation. To promote sustainability, a seed exchange system was also introduced, allowing farmers to share 8 kg of seeds with others to further propagate and multiply the variety. </p>

                                    <p>Indigenous pulse seeds are the backbone of sustainable agriculture in the rainfed landscapes of Dhenkanal. These traditional varieties, deeply embedded in the region’s agroecological heritage, offer critical advantages, like, resilience to climate variability, resistance to droughts, enrichment of soil fertility, and a dependable source of nutrition for both human and livestock populations. Recognizing their immense value, Mahashakti Foundation has prioritized the conservation and revival of these seeds under its climate-resilient agriculture interventions.<br><br>
                                    
                                    As part of our initial engagement, a series of participatory village meetings were held, where farmers collaborated to map local seed diversity and assess the availability of traditional pulse varieties. Among the varieties discussed, Jhain Moong – a drought-resistant, green gram native to the region emerged as a variety of particular importance. However, its cultivation has been steadily declining in recent years due to limited access to quality seeds, frequent damage from open grazing, and the absence of an organized, cluster-based approach to cultivation.<br><br>
                                    
                                    With the proactive involvement of lead farmers, the project team conducted a detailed needs assessment and identified key challenges to reviving Jhain Moong. As a first step toward revitalization, 1,600 kg of Jhain Moong seeds were sourced from farmers in a neighboring block where the variety was still being grown. These seeds were distributed among 200 farmers, each receiving 8 kg for both cultivation and seed conservation.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Through this effort, 200 acres of farmland were brought under Jhain Moong cultivation, marking a significant step toward reviving this resilient pulse variety. To ensure the long-term sustainability of the initiative, a community-led seed exchange system was introduced. Under this model, participating farmers are encouraged to share 8 kg of seeds post-harvest with others in their village, fostering a ripple effect of multiplication and conservation.<br><br>
                                    
                                    This initiative not only enhances crop diversity and food security but also strengthens community ownership over seed systems- hence paving the way for a more sustainable, climate-adaptive, and self-reliant rural future. </p>
