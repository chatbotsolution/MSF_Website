                                    <p>The Integrated Village Development Programme (IVDP) works to uplift underserved villages through integrated, community-led solutions in key areas like agriculture, education, healthcare, and livelihood support. The empowerment component of IVDP has catalyzed new livelihood models across Gudvella, Madanpur Rampur and Paikmal blocks by bridging gaps in technology access and enterprise support. In each block, Custom Hiring Centres now serve over 300 small and marginal farmers, renting out power tillers, sprayers, seedling machines and other implements at affordable rates (₹50–₹500/use), boosting farm efficiency. Parallelly, backyard poultry units reached 150 women per block – each rearing 30 indigenous chicks and generated an average of ₹11,250–₹12,000 per production cycle, while goat‑rearing initiatives supported 120 families (plus one community “goat shala” per block), yielding about ₹10,000 per 150‑day cycle (and up to ₹50,000 from the larger unit).<br>
                                    Across all blocks, these combined interventions, integration of modern diagnostics, community theatre, hands-on training and home‐based nutrition gardens have fostered ownership of health behaviours and laid the groundwork for lasting improvements in maternal and child health. IVDP bridged critical gaps in access to timely testing and early disease detection, empowering villagers to receive immediate results and follow‑up advice on the spot. This innovation is especially relevant in underserved areas, where physical distance, limited resources, and workforce shortages often delay diagnosis and treatment.
