                                    <p>WOMEN LITERACY CENTRE (WLC), TPCODL Illiteracy has a profound impact on various aspects of an individual’s life. And in India, the literacy rate stands at 74%, 82% for males and 65% for females. To have a positive impact on this aspect, with the generous support of TPCODL-CSR, Mahashakti Foundation has rolled out Women’s Literacy Centers (WLC) in the slums of Bhubaneswar.<br>These Adult Women’s Literacy Centers are strategically located in and around the slums to facilitate basic literacy education for adult women without disrupting their daily routines. The primary objective is to empower these women with basic reading skills, enabling them to read newspapers and effectively manage their household finances, among other essential skills. The trainers, referred to in the project as Preraks underwent orientation programs on fundamental teaching techniques. The training program was expertly coordinated by a resource person from TCS and spanned over two virtual training sessions. The Mahashakti project management team actively participated in this training initiative. To further enhance the effectiveness of the Preraks’ training, Mahashakti’s team provided coaching in the use of digital learning modules as the project progressed across all the 10 WLCs.</p>
