                                    <p>This dual benefit of resource conservation and emission reduction underscores the project’s commitment to sustainable agriculture.<br>
                                    The main goal of the project is – Methane avoidance from the rice field through the AWD method. The project was started on 4th August, 2022. Farmers from 76 villages of Barpalii and Sohela Blocks of Bargarh participated in the project. As a result, a database of 6832 farmers has been created in the fiscal year.<br>
                                    The project achieved its stratified goals through the following strategies:
