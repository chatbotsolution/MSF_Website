                                    <p>Sabita Behera, a 35-year-old artisan from Kakarudrapur village, is scripting a remarkable transformation through Project Samriddhi, an innovative initiative under Anokha Dhaaga, implemented by Mahashakti Foundation with the support of Tata Power Central Odisha Distribution Limited. This project, aimed at reviving traditional art forms and fostering sustainable livelihoods, has provided Sabita and 240 fellow artisans with a lifeline to enhance their craft and achieve financial independence.<br><br>

Through the program, Sabita has received hands-on training in palm leaf carving and Pattachitra art, guided by a national award-winning master trainer. This intensive two-and-a-half-month training equipped her with advanced techniques and innovative design ideas. Beyond skills development, the project has ensured a robust support system, including access to high-quality raw materials, carving tools, a dedicated shared workspace for collaboration, and stipends during the training period to ease financial pressures.<br><br>

To further ensure sustainability, Project Samriddhi integrates marketing support through Kalapunaruthan Producer Company Ltd, an OFPO promoted by Mahashakti Foundation, enabling artisans to reach wider markets and showcase their intricate creations to a global audience. This comprehensive support has significantly enhanced Sabita’s daily earnings, raising them from Rs. 50-60 to Rs. 200-250 – a substantial improvement in her livelihood.
