                                    <p>The Agrahichasi Farmer Producer Organization was established in the Golamunda Block of Kalahandi District, Odisha, as a direct response to the hardships faced by the local farming community. For decades, farmers in the region relied on rain-fed paddy cultivation during the
                                    Kharif season due to the lack of irrigation facilities. This limited their agricultural output, forcing many to migrate to other states in search of better livelihood opportunities. While a few progressive farmers experimented with vegetable cultivation – growing tomatoes, chili, and bitter gourd on small plots – their efforts were hindered by distress sales, disorganized marketing practices, and a lack of technical expertise in advanced farming methods. These persistent challenges underscored the need for an organized and collaborative approach to improving agriculture in the region. </p>

                                    <p><b>Intervention:</b></p>
                                    <p>Recognizing the dire need for change, NABARD initiated the formation of the Agrahichasi FPO in December 2022 under the Central Sector Scheme for the Formation and Promotion of 10,000 FPOs. </p>

                                    <p>Partnering with the Mahashakti Foundation as a Cluster-Based Business Organization, the initiative adopted a cluster-focused strategy to support the cultivation of high-demand crops such as tomatoes, bitter gourd, and chilies. The farmers were provided with extensive training on modern agricultural practices, post-harvest management, and market engagement strategies. Additionally, licenses for the distribution of essential agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides were obtained, ensuring that farmers had access to quality resources at their doorstep.<br>The intervention also prioritized building market linkages to secure fair prices for farmers’ produce. With financial backing from NABARD, which sanctioned ₹18 lakh to cover management costs, the FPO expanded its reach across 23 villages in 8 Gram Panchayats, attracting 260 shareholders. Through the sustained guidance of Mahashakti Foundation and district-level experts, the FPO not only bolstered local agricultural practices but also established trade relationships extending beyond Odisha to states like Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and Jharkhand.</p> 

                                    <p><b>Impact</b></p>

                                    <p>The establishment of the Agrahichasi FPO has profoundly transformed the agricultural landscape of Golamunda. The turnover of the FPO saw a meteoric rise, growing from ₹11.03 lakh in 2023-24 to ₹73 lakh by the end of 2024. This dramatic increase in revenue reflects the improved production and sales infrastructure developed under the FPO’;s guidance. Farmers reported a 50% increase in income, significantly reducing migration rates as agriculture became a more viable livelihood option. The expanded scale of vegetable cultivation also generated employment opportunities, with farmers hiring local laborers to meet the demands of increased productivity. Women’s participation in the FPO strengthened their socio-economic standing, promoting inclusivity within the community. Training programs and exposure visits supported by government schemes and Krishi Vigyan Kendras further equipped farmers with cutting-edge agricultural techniques, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.</p>

Once marked by migration, the region now boasts over 200 farmers, including 45 women, cultivating 200 acres of tomatoes and 150 acres of bitter gourd.
