                                    <p>In this fiscal year, 3,017 members covered under Social Security Services like Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY), E-Shram Card, etc., were facilitated to the SHG members. Project Sakhi plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap between government social security schemes and the beneficiaries. Out of the total, 64% of members have used the credits for agriculture-based livelihoods, and 23% of SHG members engaged themselves in dairy farming (agri-allied) as their primary economic activity. Furthermore, 13% of SHG members undertook non-farm activities. This inclusive approach facilitates multiple income-generating activities, driving economic empowerment among women. </p>

                                    <p>Project Sakhi strategically leverages government resources and converges with various programs, such as “Kutia Kandha Development Agency,” ICDS, Mission Shakti, Odisha Livelihood Mission, and others. This convergence has led to an increase in social capital, physical capital/assets, and economic opportunities for women. Notably, it has also resulted in sustainable development through the creation of durable assets and enhanced productivity. Out of the convergence effort, 486 SHG members have received INR 37,64,690 from the above-mentioned Govt departments to undertake agri-allied and non-farm business activities. </p>
