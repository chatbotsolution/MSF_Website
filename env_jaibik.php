                                    <p>This project is a vital initiative tailored to the unique agricultural challenges of Western Odisha, including its susceptibility to climatic variability and often degraded soil conditions. Recognizing the region’s potential and the rising consumer demand for healthy and Naturally grown vegetables, JAIBIK aims to establish resilient, market- ready clusters that empower local farmers. The project provides targeted training in climate-resilient and chemical-free farming techniques, crucial for addressing Western Odisha’s unique climatic challenges. Additionally, it develops efficient irrigation systems to improve the region’s compromised soil health, enhancing both farmer livelihoods and environmental sustainability. It also focuses on securing better profit margins for farmers, leveraging the potential for premium pricing and establishing forward market linkages via dedicated market outlets. This holistic approach ensures that farmers in Western Odisha are not only producing high-quality, market-ready produce, but also have direct access to profitable markets, fostering long-term economic growth and ecological balance within the region. </p>
