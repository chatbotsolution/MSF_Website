                                    <p>Sabita Rana, a resident of Chakuli village in Sambalpur, is a shining example of how determination, paired with timely support, can transform lives. She lives with her family of six, including her husband, a skilled pottery artisan whose craft contributes modestly to their household income. Despite their hard work, the family’s financial struggles were significant. Sabita’s annual farming income, ranging from ₹90,000 to ₹1,00,000, barely covered basic necessities, leaving little for her children’s education or healthcare.<br><br>This all changed when Mahashakti Foundation, with the support of HDFC Bank Parivartan, introduced Project Sampurna in Sambalpur. Recognizing Sabita’s potential, she was provided with specialized training and resources to adopt advanced farming practices. Sabita focused on chilli farming and dedicated one acre of her three-acre farm to this crop. With guidance on better cultivation techniques from Project Sampurana team, Agri-Experts of Mahashakti Foundation, and access to improved markets, her efforts began to bear fruit.

                                 <p>From her chilli cultivation, Sabita achieved remarkable results:</p>
                                 <p>● Green Chili: Cultivating one acre, she produced 8 quintals, earning ₹1,44,000.</p>
                                 <p>● Red Chili: With the same dedication, she harvested 10 quintals, generating ₹1,80,000.</p>
