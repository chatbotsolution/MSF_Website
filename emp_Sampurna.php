                                    <p>This project is being implemented with the support of HDFC Bank Parivartan. The geography of the project is concentrated in the blocks of Manesar and Jamankira in Sambalpur, Bhatli, and Ambabhona in Bargarh district. During the course of the project, as many as 8,000 small and marginal women farmers shall be mobilized, and formed into Producer Groups and finally, they’ll be clubbed into an organized and registered Farmers Producer Company (FPC). The project is currently introducing new agriculture technologies, best practices, and Package of Practice (PoP) training which aim to improve farm productivity and reduce the cost of production<br><br>Project Sampurna has made substantial progress in its second year, positively impacting the lives of women farmers in Sambalpur and Bargarh. The dedication and collective efforts of the team and farmer beneficiaries have laid a solid groundwork for further success in the coming years. As per the project plan, three FPCs had to be floated in the mentioned two districts, where in Sambalpur the two FPCs shall deal with the Chilli value chain and in Bargarh the FPC shall focus on the Millet value chain.</p>
