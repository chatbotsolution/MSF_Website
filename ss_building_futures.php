                                    <p>The story of the “Pehli Udaan – Menstrual Health and Hygiene” project is a testament to the power of awareness and support in transforming lives. Implemented by Mahashakti Foundation with the support of Vedanta Limited, Lanjigarh, this initiative has brought remarkable change to the lives of girl students at Shree Jagannath High School in Jodabandh village, Lanjigarh block, Kalahandi district.<br><br>The school, catering to over 400 students in grades 8 to 10, has approximately 150 girl students. Before the intervention, around 20-25% of these girls frequently missed school due to menstrual health-related issues such as cramps, discomfort, and a lack of proper hygiene knowledge. These challenges were compounded by deep-rooted myths and stigmas surrounding menstruation, leaving many young girls feeling isolated and hesitant to discuss their concerns openly. This absenteeism not only disrupted their education but also affected their self-esteem and confidence.<br><br>Recognizing this critical need, Shaktimayee Foundation, promoted by Mahashakti Foundation, initiated a focused intervention under Vedanta’s CSR initiatives. Two awareness camps were organized, specifically addressing menstrual health and hygiene.These interactive sessions provided comprehensive information about menstruation, educating the girls on the biological processes behind it and offering practical guidance on managing common symptoms such as cramps and fatigue. The sessions also emphasized hygiene practices, including the proper use and disposal of sanitary napkins, while debunking societal myths surrounding menstruation.

                                        The training sessions were conducted by healthcare experts and resource persons who ensured the content was relatable and easy to understand. This approach created a safe space for open discussions, enabling the girls to voice their doubts and learn collectively. <br><br>The impact has been transformative. The absenteeism rate among girl students has dropped significantly to just 5-6%, marking a notable shift in their ability to attend classes regularly. Armed with knowledge and practical skills, the girls are now better equipped to manage their menstrual health effectively, without compromising their education. They are using the recommended sanitary products and have become advocates for menstrual health within their communities, sharing what they have learned with peers and family members. <br><br>Beyond improved attendance, the initiative has sparked a newfound sense of self-confidence and empowerment. The girls actively participate in academic and extracurricular activities, demonstrating a positive change in their overall well-being. Teachers and parents have also observed increased enthusiasm and engagement from the students, further validating the project’s success.<br><br>The “Pehli Udaan” initiative has not only addressed a critical health and hygiene issue but has also paved the way for brighter futures for these young girls. By breaking taboos and equipping them with the knowledge and tools to manage their health, this project has become a model for empowering rural communities and fostering gender equity in education. It highlights the profound impact of combining education, health, and social support in creating a more inclusive and equitable society.
