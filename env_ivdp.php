                                    <p>The Integrated Village Development Programme (IVDP) is a holistic rural development initiative aimed at transforming underserved communities through sustainable environmental interventions, empowerment, education, and health & nutrition interventions. Environmental sustainability lies at the heart of the IVDP, aiming to strengthen climate resilience and natural resource management in underserved rural regions. Implemented across the blocks of Gudvella (Balangir), Madanpur Rampur (Kalahandi), and Paikmal (Bargarh), through strategic interventions like excavation and renovation of farm ponds, check dams, and diversion weirs, the program enhanced irrigation coverage across more than 300 acres of farmland. These water conservation structures directly benefited over 150 small and marginal farmers, helping reduce dependence on erratic rainfall and improving crop productivity. In areas prone to climate variability with limited irrigation, this has enabled year-round cultivation and contributed to improved groundwater recharge.To further promote sustainable agriculture, over 3,900 fruit-bearing saplings were planted across 60 acres of upland terrain, providing long-term income avenues. </p>

                                    <p>Model nurseries were set up to supply quality saplings to farmers, while solar-powered cold storage units (5 MT capacity) were installed to minimize post-harvest losses and stabilize prices. Additionally, solar streetlights were introduced in remote habitations, enhancing safety and enabling evening mobility. These interventions have collectively helped restore ecological balance, diversify livelihoods, and lay the foundation for climate-adaptive rural development. </p>
